Each level adds increasingly deadlier challenges, so stay on your toes!\r\n\r\nTo help you out, there are powerups scattered around the map. Touch them with a Kodachi to activate them.  More powerups will spawn at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nIf all your Kodachis are dead, you lose the round. Don't worry, you get to try again!",
