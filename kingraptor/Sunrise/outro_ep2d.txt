"That''s the last time I go on any ''salvage'' missions," Ada muttered when they were finally back on the [i]Eden[/i]. "Just what kind of screwy operation were they running down there?"

"It appears to have been a chicken breeding facility," Sophia said. "The Dynasty were suspected to operate such ranches to raise specimens for their research."

"Mad scientists, each and every one of them." The former Imperial captain grimaced. "I knew they were never much for sensible constraints on their biological research, but this is going too far, even for them!"

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "You think they should do their experiments on chickens captured from the wild instead?"

"I think they shouldn''t do those experiments at all!"

"Even if they come up with an effective, long-term solution to the chicken problem? Those creatures have been plaguing human space since the Planetwars, you know."

"Well. Maybe. But I still don''t trust them. In fact, I think they caused the chickens in the first place!" Ada muttered something unintelligible to herself, then glanced at her aide. "Think [i]they''re[/i] still around? Or that they wiped themselves out with one of their own creations? Now that would be poetic."

"I cannot say, friend Ada, not without more information. We are not too far from what was then their space, but the base logs indicated no contact with the outside for several hundred years. It is unclear whether the base has simply been forgotten, or if there is no-one left to check on it any longer." She cocked her head. "In any case, we should be able to investigate once the ship is repaired. For now, I do not believe there is any further purpose in our presence here."

"I agree," Ada sighed. "Let''s get out of here before something even more messed up happens."
