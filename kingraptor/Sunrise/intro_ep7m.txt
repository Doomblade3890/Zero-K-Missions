The Machine attack force was inside the perimeter.

They wouldn't have gotten there, the way the defenses had originally been set up. Heavy laser towers and missile turrets overlooked EMG emplacements with overlapping fields of fire, able to pour enfilade fire down the shallow, landmined trenches in front of the perimeter. Over the defence line, shield generators cast their protective bubbles, a comforting barrier against hostile fire.

But the defenses were not as they had been set up. Three times already the Free Machines had struck, wave after wave of bots trying to force their way through to the base behind. Three times they'd been driven back, but at a heavy cost, and there'd been little time to restore the defences.

And now the fourth wave was upon them.

Skirmisher rockets arced through the air like a hail of ancient javelins, but far more lethal. Explosions rippled across the surface of the shield bubbles, then on metal and earth as the generators gave way, and the air was thick with the dying sounds of war machines. The defender's Thug assault bots stood firm, facing down half again their number in their own kind, even as disruptor pulses shorted and scrambled their circuitry. The air was thick with smoke, hot with scorching lasers and plasma.

The wavefront hit a cliff, washing back, but then the jumpers leapt into the fray, Pyros spitting fire and Jacks with sharp lances. Defender after defender went up in fire, and the attackers, battered but not broken, clawed their way over the wreckage into the base interior.

Streams of coherent light from the final defense perimeter met them, a command unit and two LLTs fighting a last-ditch holding action. More hostile robots succumbed to the damage, and then the base's last Roach detonated, tearing a great gaping wound in their already irregular formation. Any advance by a human force would have faltered... but these were no humans at all.

The attackers still flowing through the breach retaliated, fire and plasma blowing apart one of the turrets, then the other. Alone now, the commander waded into the fray, laser still cutting a swathe through her enemies. One Pyro got too close, and a backhand took its head clean off; a sunburst shot forth from the other arm, and a Jack evaporated in a fireball as its hydrogen tanks detonated. They were finally crumbling, now; yet they fought still, bolt after bolt of energy pitting and gouging the demon's armor, and a shower of sparks erupted from her plasma accelerator. Yet for that the weapon was better off than its companion - a stray missile hit had reduced the laser emitter to slag.

Alarms shrieked inside the cockpit, but only one enemy remained, now: a single Thug, still blasting away with its plasma cannons. The commander lunged forward, driving her right fist into her foe's face, and the sunburst charge let go. Her victim's arms were still recognizable, just barely, as the resulting explosion hurled them away; the half-vaporized torso was not.

She retracted the now-useless arm, standing straight, and looked over the remains before her. The wreckage was still sizzling hot, but the field was at last quiet again... for now.

Ada Eveline Caedmon exhaled slowly, freshly aware of the sweat trickling down her forehead. "I don't think we can take much more of this. How's the excavation going? ...Sophia?"

She narrowed her eyes, then brought up a system monitor, and glared at it. "Sophia, you're supposed to be concentrating on getting those striders out! Not on decrypting random files, and especially not diverting cycles from your comm service to do it?"

[i]<Hmm?>[/i] The AI was speaking through the neural link; she wasn't bothering to bring up the speakers or her avatar display. [i]Oh, sorry, got distracted. But you'll never guess what I found in the databanks, Ada.[/i]

[i]<What could it be that's worth getting sidetracked like this!? If you haven't noticed, we just barely held off their last attack as it is!>[/i]

[i]<Right, right. But listen, Ada... I think this is the source code of the original Firebrand virus.>[/i]

"What!?" Ada had shot halfway upright in her seat before she realised she'd blurted that out loud, and settled sheepishly back down. [i]<Okay, fine, that[/i] is [i]noteworthy. But we kind of have more pressing concerns, all the same!>[/i]

She studied the map again. They'd hit the planet of Spartacus in the Reluctor binary system like a lightning bolt, before the bulk of the Free Machines' forces could be mustered. But the damnable toasters had since more than made up for it, and the old Planetwars-era armaments fabrication and storage facility in the valley she'd occupied was now encircled by a sea of angry red. The only way out was through the Libertas Machina's own command group right in front of her.

And at the same time, and despite what she'd said, she had to admit Sophia's discovery was making her quite curious. [i]Not that it'll matter if we die here, though. Focus, Ada.[/i] She transmitted her thoughts again: [i]<How much longer? Sophia?>[/i]

[i]<It'll take another hour or so to reach the bottom of this hangar. As for the decryption... we'll see.>[/i]

[i]<Alright, then,>[/i] and despite the tension of the situation, Ada felt a thin smile form on her face. [i]<Good enough. Good enough.>[/i]
