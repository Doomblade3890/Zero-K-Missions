"And not a moment too soon," Ada muttered as the [i]Shadow of Eden[/i] sped away from the planet with its full 240 g''s of acceleration. "The second visit was even worse than the first."

"Our return could have been under better circumstances, yes," Sophia said. "I am more concerned about other matters, however."

Ada leaned forward, resting her elbows on the armrests. "Like what a Legionnaire was doing in the back end of nowhere like Apokia?"

"Indeed. In fact, I ran a query of the data we obtained from Antikythera, and it turns out that in the past three thousand years, the Imperial Vanguard Legion has only been deployed to the Trajan Sector twice." The virtual woman frowned. "Not counting our most recent encounter."

"A coincidence, perhaps," Ada offered. "There was no way they could have known we were coming here."

"Perhaps. On the other hand, this is the shortest route into Imperial territory from Tsiolkovsky''s Star. They may have thought it prudent to shore up their defenses here after it fell."

"But the [i]Legion?[/i]" Ada asked incredulously. "I mean, I suppose we should be flattered if they consider us that big a threat, but..."

Sophia shook her head. "I think that is a question best left for another time. In any case, my real concern is the implications this has for our operation."

"Yeah," Ada sighed. "I suppose it''s a long shot from here to the Throne world - especially if we''re squaring off with Legionnaires every step of the way."

"A problem, yes." The corners of Sophia''s lips twitched. "But problems can often be turned into opportunities."

Ada cocked a dark eyebrow. "How so?"

"I do not know yet. However, there must be a reason the Vanguard Legion is here in the Trajan Sector. If we can determine what that reason is... we might yet be able to take advantage of it."
