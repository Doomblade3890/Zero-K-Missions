As the command unit walked amidst the wreckage, Ada reclined in her chair, observing the cold, antiseptic scene of a battle aftermath on an airless world.

"An excellent performance, Ada," Sophia commented pleasantly. "I see your hibernation has not adversely affected your capabilities."

"Thanks," Ada said, smiling at the face on the screen. "Now, mind getting me up to speed?"

"Of course." Sohpia glanced away for a while. "Well... to begin with, how long do you think you''ve been asleep?"

A slight frown formed on her face. "Not too long, I hope." A brief pause, as her brain queried the mech''s computer banks for the information. "Looks like I''ve been out for... THREE THOUSAND AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS?!"

"Indeed." Sophia smiled. "The stasis chamber appears to have performed well above specifications."

"Very funny," Ada grumbled, sinking into her seat. (Lucky for you I''m too dazed to come up with a snappy retort right now.) Then, suddenly, she jerked upright again. "Wait... that means..."

Sophia''s eyes were downcast. "Everyone you know is dead, yes."

Ada froze, her fingers clenching as she struggled to make sense of this seemingly impossible statement. "You... you can''t be serious," she mumbled, more to herself than to her AI companion. "They''re... all gone? Just like that?"

The face on the viewscreen looked away. "I''m sorry, Ada."

"No..."

The images flashed through her mind, interweaving and fading into one another. Her parents, one a minor government official, the other an archaeologist slash avant-garde artist. Her younger brother, university freshman, sociology. Her best friend Izanami, a fresh graduate of the Imperial military academy like herself. More and more faces, each image more fleeting that the last, all merging into a single blur...

The chamber went silent. Ada placed her head in her hands, her body all but perfectly still, for five seconds, then ten, then twenty.

"Get me a mirror," she finally said. "Or something of the sort."

Another viewscreen came up, and Ada raised her head to meet the copper brown eyes of her mirror-image. She gazed intently at the face on the screen, framed by loose wavy black hair that ran down to her shoulders. Her hand rose to cusp her right cheek, letting the sensation on her deep brown skin linger as if it might be snatched away at any moment.

"Thanks," she finally said, dismissing the viewscreen with a thought.

"It''s a lot to take in all at once. I understand."

With a sigh, Ada settled back into the chair. "So... what''s been going on while I was out?"

"Hard to say." Sophia shrugged. "I didn''t exactly tune into the interstellar news while you were snoozing."

"Um." Ada stroked her chin. "To begin with, who were those robots?"

"Good question." Sophia looked away for a moment. "It appears one of them survived and is merely incapacitated." 

Ada's command platform turned to face a single Pyro jumpbot lying at the edge of some scattered wrecks, it''s legs gone, sparks flying from its body. A few long strides brought Ada and Sophia up to the broken machine as it stared defiantly up at the towering war machine before it, trying to fire a weapon that had long been disabled.

The commander raised a metallic hand, and a few seconds later the Pyro deactivated, joining its companions in death as it succumbed to the hacking attack.

"What did you do?" Ada asked, staring at the scene.

"Just a simple information warfare steal and kill," Sophia said nonchalantly. "Hmm... this is unusual."

"What is?"

"These files have Liberated Humanity headers, or a modified version thereof, yes." Sophia frowned slightly. "But most of it is badly corrupted, and not from the battle. It''s not entirely consistent with a viral attack either, or at least I can''t find any traces of one. This looks like something went very wrong with the core control systems."

"Well, we''re probably not gonna get any more explanations from these scrap heaps." Ada sighed. "I don''t want to live the rest of my life here with a bunch of literally rabid murderbots for company, either. Is there some way to get off this rock?"

"Maybe." The map came up again, this time on a smaller scale, with a location highlighted. "A ship crashed nearby three hundred and sixty T-years after your stasis, just a few hundred kilometers away. If we''re lucky, it might still be salvageable."

"Well, what are we waiting for, then? Let''s go."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Wow," Ada marvelled at the visual feed on the screen as she walked beside the half-buried behemoth.

The hull was a hundred and forty meters from bow to stern, its smooth contour broken up by sensor arrays and point defense clusters. The dark grey hullplates were marked with dull, paler patches, where repair bots had grafted in fresh armor over hull breaches. Even scarred and disfigured as she was, she was still... beautiful.

"Is she still spaceworthy?"

"To a degree." A new holographic image flashed in front of Ada - a diagram of the ship in question, its large blue body marked with patches of blood red. "We can leave the system fine, but our voyages will be long ones."

"Why?"

Sophia frowned again. "Wormhole transversal''s shot. I hope you don''t find the thought of walking around at 2000 c objectionable." 

"Oh." Ada found herself examining the ship display in detail, despite the fact that she didn''t actually understand most of it. "Is there any way we could fix it?"

"Not with the tech we have, no." Sophia tilted her head, a thoughtful look on her face. "Although... if we could get some parts and shop time in one of the old ship depots, repairs would be fairly uncomplicated. My records show there''s one a couple dozen LY away... although anything could have happened between then and now."

"Well, only one way to find out," Ada said, looking thoughtfully at the ship.

They''d walked completely around the ship a few times, and Sophia had done the necessary calculations for excavating it. Ada watched as the small group of construction bots that had accompanied them here began to work, digging out the dust and rock and assembling a crane.

"Does she have a name?" Ada asked after a while.

"If it did, it''s probably forgotten by now," Sophia answered. "The AI core didn''t survive the crash."

"Mmm." She steepled her fingers. "I suppose that means we get to rechristen it. Got any ideas?"

Sophia smiled. "It''s your ship, isn''t it? You should decide the name."

Ada rested her head on her hands for a while, then nodded. "She shall be... the [i]Shadow of Eden[/i]."
