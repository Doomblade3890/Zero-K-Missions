[Transcript of Captain Ada Caedmon''s inter-sector broadcast to the Imperial territories, after the sack of Throne]

"Citizens of the Empire, this is Ada Caedmon. Warlord of Tsiolkovsky''s Star, savior of Tryphon, vanquisher of the Legion, and conqueror of the Throne."

"I come to you not to speak of my deeds, but to tell you of what lies ahead. The Emperor is dead - and with him, the Empire. Its leadership has been destroyed, secular and ecclesiastical alike; its legions have been scattered to the winds. The past Imperial order is gone, a memory."

"There is no-one left to tell you what to do. No censor to levy your taxes, no tribune to shape your laws, no clergy to direct your faith, no legionnaire to defend your borders... and no god-emperor around whom your society may revolve. All these things and more you now hold in your own hands."

"You must now decide on the road before you. Whether to work to restore the Empire of old or build something new in its place, or whether to even make the attempt. Who will lead you in these difficult time? What kind of polities and communities will you build? Those are questions you must answer for yourself."

"My quest takes me elsewhere in the galaxy. Perhaps, in time, I shall return to see what has become of that which once called itself the Empire."

"Until then, I bid you farewell."
