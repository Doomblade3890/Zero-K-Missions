Belisarius is a quasi-terran planet slightly smaller than Earth, orbiting the G1 star Justinian in the Imperial Core Sector. The larger of its two moons, Anastasius, is up to 14% its mass and orbits at 420,000 km; the other, Valentinian, masses 9% of the primary and has an orbital distance of 860,000 km. Their combined effect results in combined spring tides of up to 25 m in some locations. 

Originally a largely arid world, rocky and with little native life, extensive terraforming was carried out during the planet''s development to create an environment more hospitable for humans. As the PlanetWars progressed, environmental degradation caused much of the surface to revert to its pre-terraformed state.

Despite its proximity to the Throne world of the First Empire, Belisarius was only settled to any significant capacity during the Second Empire, where it became a focal point in the battle against the pirates of the Unaligned Worlds. Extensive shipbuilding and garrison facilities were built here, later proving to be invaluable for supporting Imperial offensives against its foes in the Dynasty of Earth and Cybernetic Front.
