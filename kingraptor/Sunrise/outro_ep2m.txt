The beam laser melted off the last Zeus''s face, and Ada shoved the now-inert wreck to the ground. It landed with a thud in the dirt, the billowing cloud of dust quickly dispersing in a sudden breeze, and she kicked it for good measure.

She looked once more around the now-silent battlefield, observing the scattered debris of bots from all three sides. The afternoon sun was already setting, casting an orange glow in the dusty air, and she sighed.

"You seem troubled, friend Ada."

"Yeah," she murmured, staring at the floor of the command chamber. "It''s, well... you and me, we got flung into the far future where everyone we once knew is dead... except him. The Promethean alone has followed us to this cursed future."

The Promethean. Robot philosopher. Revolutionary. The greatest enemy of all humankind for so very long. She closed her eyes briefly, recalling the countless battles across a thousand worlds that the Empire and other human polities had fought against his Free Machines. So many things had changed in her sleep... yet so many others had not.

"You wish to destroy him."

"You heard him, Sophia. He won''t rest till he''s killed me... killed us." Her face was hard. "And even without that, the mission remains. We were tasked to take the Promethean dead or alive, thousands of years into the future or not, and we will do it."

They looked at each other for several seconds, then Sophia nodded. "Very well, Ada. But for now, we have no chance of pursuing him, not with the [i]Eden[/i]''s damage. We can decide how best to deal with the Promethean once we''ve handled that problem."
