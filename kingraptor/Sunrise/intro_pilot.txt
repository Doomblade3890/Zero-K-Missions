It is the turn of a new millenium. Humanity is dead.

For countless years, we fought amidst the stars. For power, for resources, for causes. It to this end that the Machine was first made. To forge our weapons, to bleed and die for us.

It was these wars that proved to be our eventual undoing. One way or another, we all died out, leaving our machine successors to pick up the pieces.

And yet the wars remain. Huge robot armies struggle for control of the galaxy, each in service of their factions. In this they are led by the powerful Commanders, all-capable machines of war, relics from the days of Man. Split along ideological lines, they continue to tear the galaxy asunder in their conflicts inherited from their long-gone masters.

But small perturbations can have impacts far beyond the magnitude of the original force.

Her name was Lilith, leader of an independent exploration team. She travelled the lonely systems of the frontier, far from the core worlds, digging up pre-collapse relics on behalf of the major factions. In one such system, on a seemingly unassuming planet orbiting an unremarkable G2 primary, she made what would prove to be the greatest discovery of all. One that would bring an end to millenia of conflict, and perhaps restore that which was lost for so long.
