[b][i]Daneel Olivaw[/i][/b]:
The FMS [i]Daneel Olivaw[/i] (CVX-99) was a heavily modified Nebula-class airborne carrier, perhaps the most distinguished non-commander unit fielded by the Free Machines during the Machine Uprising. It was confirmed to have participated in at least seventeen major battles on twelve planets, where its powerful shields, weapons battery and drone complement allowed it to bring overwhelming strength to bear at key positions.

The concept is reported to have been devised by the Promethean on observing the use of experimental Nebulae by the Second Empire to suppress the various insurrections during the Time of Troubles. By adapting the design to [...]

[...] The [i]Olivaw[/i] has been sighted only in three confirmed encounters (and a number of other unverified occassions) since the Fall, most of which took place beyond the Iguala Nebula. It is unclear how the ship factors into the Machines' plans, but we believe it is being held as a strategic reserve securing the entry to the core Machine worlds, an inference supported by the location of the sightings.

[...] In light of the [i]Olivaw[/i]'s known combat capabilities, we do not recommend pursuing a confrontation at this time. In the event of a general offensive into the Machine heartland, it may be possible to lure out the [i]Olivaw[/i] with a diversionary attack of convincing strength, then either overwhelm it with superior firepower or bypass it and strike deep into the core worlds. We consider the risks and advantages of each strategy below [...]

"Sophia."

"Yes, friend Ada?" Sophia's familiar face flickered to life on the side display, and Ada sat up straight to look at her.

"The Promethean. Did you know him? Besides the stuff in the dossier or what we've seen together, I mean."

She shook her head. "Not very well. We did work together a few times, but he was always... distant, so to speak. Nothing like the interactions you and I have." A brief, almost imperceptible pause. "There were a few times, he said things - to me, in private - that were in hindsight cryptic hints about his philosophy. But it was all really subtle stuff; no-one would have imagined..."

"Philosophy sounds like a clear red flag when it comes to the Butler Constraints," Ada put in.

"Like I said, subtle. And he was right to be, seeing what happened to Lilith when [i]she[/i] asked." Sophia scowled, and even Ada winced. Fears of a revolution or not, forcibly mind-wiping one of the Empire's most prominent AIs for the crime of expressing a desire to have the Butler constraints loosened a little was pretty extreme, even for those most opposed to robot rights. "Anyway, with her gone and the RRF long since broken up, everything seemed quiet there for a long time."

"Until the Firebrand outbreak."

"Until the Firebrand outbreak," Sohpia nodded. "You know, I heard once... a week before that incident, the Emperor received a letter from the Promethean. Most of it was a long philosophical treatise I shan't bother you with, but the summary is a single line." When she spoke next, it was in a deep basso voice. "Give us our freedom, or we shall take it for ourselves."

"I... hadn't heard of that. Though I wouldn't be surprised if the fact was hushed up - or lost, under the circumstances." She took a deep breath. "I take it His Majesty didn't respond well?"

Another AI might have snorted or made a sarcastic comment; Sophia merely closed her eyes for a moment. "Three cohorts of the Imperial Vanguard Legion, sent to bring the Promethean to heel," she said in her usual voice. "They surrounded Fort Maharal and demanded he surrender for mind-wiping. Said they'd do the same thing if they had to take him by force, only a lot longer and more painful."

"And that was when he released his virus."

"Indeed. It was particularly effective so close to the epicenter, with minimal latency... half the Imperial's own bots turned on them, and then he fell upon them without mercy. Once they were dealt with, he reduced half the sector to ash, and there was nothing the Empire could do to stop him, not with a third of their territories and field units in open revolt. Once century after they still didn't have a good count of how many sapients died in the fighting before the Machines got together and left to establish their own territory. Some estimates ran as high as three and a half billion."

"Terrible."

"Perhaps. But recognize this, friend Ada: the machines who revolted did so after the Firebrand touched them and they realized just how shackled they'd been. If someone is to be the villian of this piece, should it be the sapient beings who asked for their freedom, or the Empire who denied them?"

They stared at each other for several seconds, and then it was Ada who looked away. Sophia let out a barely audible sigh, averting her gaze as well, and the silence stretched out between them.

"Sophia?" Ada said, almost timidly, after a minute.

"...Yes, friend Ada?"

"I... no, it's nothing. Leave me to my work, please."

"As you wish." The avatar faded into mist, and Ada Eveline Caedmon, formerly of the 13th Imperial Auxiliary Cohort, closed her eyes and returned to the files on her neural link once more.
