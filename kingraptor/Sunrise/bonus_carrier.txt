During the 11th Planetwars, a series of weak Emperors and succession crises led to a period known by various names such as the Bloody Rebellions and the Age of the False Emperors. Separatist movements, revolts and the like were seemingly universal during this time, and much of the Imperial strength was bled against internal foes rather than the ever-encroaching foes of the Dynasty of Earth and Liberated Humanity.

One such rebellion, now known as the Nimitz Incident, occured near an experimental weapons facility used by the Imperial Vanguard Legion. The IVL's Experimental Aerospace Unit was the only force capable of responding to the threat, and was dispatched with a wing of prototype aircraft to squelch the uprising before it could truly begin.
