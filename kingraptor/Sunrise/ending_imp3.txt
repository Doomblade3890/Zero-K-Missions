The fires were still burning in the distance when Sophia''s holographic avatar flowed in next to her seat. Ada made no response to her friend and aide''s appearance for several ticking seconds, gazing out at the smoke rising over the horizon, before finally looking up.

"Status?"

"All resistance on the planet has been subdued, and the inner system is under our control," Sophia reported cripsly. "Dominion, Principality and a few of the belter stations are still holding out, but it won''t matter before long. The scuttling charges have been installed on ninety-six percent of the facilities we can reach, and the remainder should be done within the next two hours."

"And the wormholes?"

"Total Collapse is ready to go. It''ll split the Imperial territories into twenty-three separate regions, each of which will have no more than two connections to any others for at least four hundred T-years, and none at all for the first hundred. The remainder will be restored progressively over a thousand years from now."

"Good. Thank you, Sophia."

She returned her attention to the ashes of her handiwork, the sun setting behind her... setting on the Empire that had lasted for millenia. All its institutions, its culture... by tomorrow, everything it stood for would be nothing but a memory.

[i]How will history remember me? As the greatest villain of our times? A ruthless conqueror? Or just someone doing what she had to do? Will anyone even be around to remember anything?[/i]

She shook the thoughts out of her head. "Let us depart, Sophia. There is nothing left for us here."
