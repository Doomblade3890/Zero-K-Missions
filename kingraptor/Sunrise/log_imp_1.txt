"...incompetent fools... losing two thousand tons of spare parts at this critical juncture..."

"...at least four different barbarian tribes pressing into the sector [...] CPU spinning... I can''t let myself be deadlocked in agitation..."

"...Damn the Brigand, anyway! That vile, treasonous, meddlesome [i]fool[/i] turned what was supposed to have been a lesson to uppity outlanders everywhere into another lesson - and exactly the wrong one [...] humiliated, invincible reputation tattered [...] now every third-rate warlord in the Fringe and even the Shell [...] carve out his own little piece of the weakened Empire''s territory..."

"...supposedly loyal systems were electing to emulate Tryphon''s example and taking their security - and their government - into their own hands [...] cowards and traitors, the whole lot of them [...] When the Emperor hears of the heretical plague..."

"...judgement [...] found unworthy [...] a failure [...] after all that I''ve given [...] to be thwarted by the heretics and betrayers..."

"...no, I must not doubt [...] I can stll face them here, on Barchan [...] crush them in his name [...] it is they, and not I, upon whom his wrath shall fall..."

"Don't give me that garbage!"

The AI descendants of humanity did not use facial expressions when speaking with each other. Had this communication item been fed through a anthropormorphizer, however, it would have depicted Scipio Astra scowling quite ferociously, indeed.

"We have at least four different barbarian tribes pressing into the sector, headed for this very planet in less than thirty-six hours, and you're telling me you managed to lose two thousand tons of spare parts required for the orbital defense network?!"

Fortunately, the hapless subcommander routine the Prefect was venting her spleen on was not programmed to feel resentment at superiors taking out their anger on it. Not even when the loss in question was hardly its fault - an incomplete geologic survey merely led to the warehouse dropped by a sinkhole into an underground resevoir. Instead, it merely remained silent while Astra's CPUs spun in agitation.

[i]Damn the Brigand, anyway![/i] she thought bitterly. That vile, treasonous, meddlesome [i]fool[/i] had turned what was supposed to have been a lesson to uppity outlanders everywhere into another lesson - and exactly the wrong one. The Praetorian Guard has been humiliated, its invincible reputation tattered - and now every third-rate warlord in the Fringe and even the Shell was looking to carve out his own little piece of the weakened Empire's territory. Worse yet, just as many otherwise supposedly loyal systems were electing to emulate Tryphon's example and taking their security - and their government - into their own hands. When the Emperor heard of the heresy spreading like plague out here...

She shuddered at the thought, or the machine equivalent thereof, and whispered a prayer as the fear threatened to overtake her. Fear of being judged by Him, and found unworthy, found a failure. Her faith in Him and been unwavering, and she had given everything she had to His cause, yet the heathens and traitors had thwarted her. Had she doubted at the critical moment, that His foes should rise like this?

[i]No... not yet![/i]

She wasn't beaten yet. She could still crush the uppity barbarians here, then seek out the Brigand and repay her with interest. See to it that His wrath fell on them who opposed him, and not his loyal servant who had but suffered a setback in defense of the realm.

As she felt the faith, the confidence flow back into her, Scipio Astra returned to her conversation with her subordinate.

"No matter," she said firmly. "Concentrate on strengthening our land fortifications; reassign all units from the defense network to this task. We shall face them on the field of battle, and crush them where they stand."
