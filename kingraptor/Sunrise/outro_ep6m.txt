[i]Addendum:[/i] Remarkably, this transmission was made using a known unsecure encryption that was relatively trivial to break using our resources. I suspect the Promethean wants us to know he knows we're coming. Be careful, Ada. -Sophia

EXCERPT BEGINS

[b]Promethean[/b]: [...] Daneel Olivaw has fallen.

[b]Free Machine[/b]: Unacceptable!

[b]P[/b]: "Unacceptable" is an after-the-fact value judgement. It is not pertinent here.

[b]FM[/b]: ...My apologies, lord. I was merely spontaneously expressing displeasure at learning of this event. It will not happen again.

[b]P[/b]: Regardless, our problem remains. We estimate (p=0.95) the human Ada Caedmon will reach the final system within 6.2 standard weeks in the absence of an immediate intervention.

[b]FM[/b]: I concur with my lord's estimate.

[b]P[/b]: We cannot (p = 0.9872) stop her short of the Asimov Boundary, and even then yours is the only force that will meet her before she breaks through barring atypical circumstances (p = 0.792). This will be your fight.

[b]FM[/b]: I can depart within 8.2 standard hours (p = 0.95).

[b]P[/b]: We have tried to best her once with subterfuge, and failed. Twice with brute force, and failed. You must consider now how to defeat her.

[b]FM[/b]: Perhaps we need simply combine the two.

[b]P[/b]: We do not anticipate it being so simple. But you will be the one to face her. The discretion is yours.

[b]FM[/b]: I will not fail you, my lord.

[b]P[/b]: ...We shall see. Depart, and bear our torch in the darkness that falls.
