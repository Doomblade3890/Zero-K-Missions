The cabin wasn''t really exploding around her. It just sounded like it.

Ada''s ears were still ringing as her head mechanically turned to look at the damage report on her console. Four of the six powerful fusion torch drives at the [i]Eden''s[/i] stern flashed blood red on the diagram, indicating that they were, at present, so much dead weight.

"What happened, Sophia? Is it an ambush?"

"Negative," Sophia said. "Sensors detect no other ships in the system, nor any sign of weapons fire. The repair drones are inspecting the damage now." A brief pause. "Appears to be a large kinetic impact, probably from an small asteroid. Initial assessment is that the damage is outside our repair capability using shipboard resources."

"...You jumped us into the path of an asteroid?"

"I prefer to say that the asteroid jumped into our path," Sophia said evenly. "The collision could not have been predicted, at any rate."

"Right, right." Ada glared. "But regardless of whose reference frame we use, the outcome is that we''re stranded here. Correct?"

"Not so bad." Sophia smiled slightly. "We can still generate about thirty gravities of acceleration."

"Stranded!" She jabbed a finger at the main viewport, where the (mostly) garden world of Apokia II floated in space. "And here, too! God, I never once imagined we''d be stuck in this backwood system a [i]second[/i] time." She sniffled. "I bet you by now, the Empire''s forgotten this place even exists. We''re probably the only people to come calling here in a thousand years. And if we''re lucky, it''ll only be twice that before the [i]next[/i] visitor comes." Scowling: "I saw enough of this dump for [i]two[/i] lifetimes the first time I was here!"

"You''re being melodramatic," the AI said evenly. "If nothing else, this planet appears to be reasonably attractive as a retirement home."

Ada started to sputter indignantly, then cut herself off. She did permit herself an overly dramatic sigh as she leaned back in her chair, however. "So... what now?"

"The system may have materials we can use to perform the necessary repairs. We can mine the asteroids and fabricate some replacement parts for the engines." The rendered avatar glanced briefly at the planet. "If that fails, we can see if Apokia II has the necessary equipment."

"Joy." Ada let out another sigh. "This place brings back more bad memories with each passing second."

She slumped back as Sophia silently guided the limping ship on to an intercept vector with the system''s asteroids, thinking grumpy thoughts... then suddenly sat up again. "Sophia, do you remember the secret cache we made while we were stationed here?" She grinned. "You know, the one that you insisted on us squirreling away, no matter how much I complained about how unnecessary it was?"

For just a brief instant, the AI''s virtual eyes went wide. "Ah, that cache! Yes, I see what you''re getting at. Assuming it''s remained safely hidden and functional since it was built, the parts we require should be there." A small smile formed on her face. "Worth a look, at the very least. Excellent insight, Ada."

The ship turned around, headed for the blue-green orb in the distance, and Ada leaned back, rather pleased with herself. But she was soon frowning again.

"Are we there yet?"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shuttle''s powerful thrusters weren''t really cracking the ground open with their combined twenty-five thousand kilonewtons of thrust. It just sounded that way.

"Only three more loads to go," Sophia said as they watched the cargo lifter rising in the sky on a pillar of vapor. "Aren''t you glad you had my foresight with you all these years?"

"It''s quite impressive," Ada said thoughtfully. "It would be even better if you had the foresight not to collide with asteroids in the first place, though."

A dismissive flick of the hand. "Be serious, Ada. Besids, is this planet really so bad? Sure, it may have little strategic value, and the climate is generally dry, but - [i]Contact![/i] Eight o''clock high!"

Ada startled, for a moment. Just a moment - then years of traning and experience took over, as she brought up the tactical display. Sophia was already wheeling the commander around, assault cannon tracking on the interloper.

A single Dart scout bike stood atop a nearby mound, its light pulse cannon pointing at her. A few seconds later, three Scorcher raider tanks pulled up in clouds of dust, their turrets tracking as one. All four vehicles bore the IFF codes of the Empire.

On her comm screen, the face of a white-bearded man in antique-looking armor - Greek or Roman, if her memory served - appeared. "I am Legate Fides, of His Imperial Majesty''s Vanguard Legion," he said, and Ada felt a sudden chill in her spine.

[i]The Legion? Here?[/i]

His gray, flinty eyes were glaring at her now. "I believe I am speaking to the barbarian who sacked Antikythera, Ada Caedmon. A barbarian who pretends to be a soldier in service of the Empire, no less. Surrender and we will go lightly on you."

"Barbarian?! Pretends?!" Ada snapped, despite her own apprehension. "I''ll have you know Sophia and I were defending the Empire''s borders long before your animus was even instantiated, you arrogant oaf!"

"Patience, friend Ada!" Sophia counseled, and the chagrined woman slowly closed her mouth. "Legate Fides," she said, using the audio feed rather than a direct data transmission for Ada''s benefit, "we seek no quarrel with the Emperor. We simply journeyed here from the outlands where we were stationed for the past few thousand T-years, to pay our respects to the Emperor. We have heard that aside from Ada here, he is the last remaining human, and-"

"The Emperor [i]is[/i] the last remaining human, barbarian heathen," Fides growled. "To imply otherwise - as you have just done - is heresy." He was giving them the evil eye, now. "Even were it not so, your crimes at Tsiokovsky''s Star demand accounting. Submit to the Emperor''s judgement, or be destroyed!"

[i]Sophia, what do we do?[/i] she transmitted her thoughts through the neural link. [i]We[/i] are [i]guilty, you know. And if we go with it, we could get closer to the Emperor.[/i]

[i]Not a chance,[/i] Sophia answered sullenly. [i]He''ll just throw us before some low-level magistrate, who''ll have us executed by firing squad. The Empire has never been known for its mercy to "barbarians," even during our time.[/i]

[i]So...[/i]

She didn''t even need to look to see that the normally calm Sophia was now grinning ferally. [i]Do what we do best, Ada. Do unto others.[/i]

The command unit suddenly pivoted twenty degress, firing its cannon. The plasma bolt struck one of the Scorchers dead center, the small AFV exploding in a scatter of debris as the heat of a star gutted its way to the vehicle''s own reactor.

"That''s my answer, Legate," Ada said pleasantly to the snarling legionnaire in her viewscreen.
