<enemies moving along path>

Traitors, rebels and heretics, hear my words!

<ally bases>

You have come for the Emperor, but all you will find here is your death.

<allies and enemies battle>

You trespass on his soil, lay waste to his works, and now you seek to defile his very throne.

<Bertha fires>

Now the Emperor rises, and His wrath shall shake the galaxy!

// We are the Praetorian Guard, the greatest champions of the Empire.

<Detriment closeup>

Our will is resolute. Our faith is limitless. Our vengeance shall know no bounds.

Ready yourselves, foes of the Empire, for today is your judgement day!
