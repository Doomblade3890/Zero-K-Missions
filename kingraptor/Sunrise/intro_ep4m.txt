"It''s quiet," Ada Caedmon whispered to no-one in particular. "Too quiet."

She studied the old base surrounding her once more. Sited on the dusty world of Rossum, the fourth planet of the K3 star Synthes, it had been a forward outpost of some importance during the Free Machines'' battles against the old Empire. With the Fall and the loss of so much of the old technology, a mostly functional installation like this one should have become extremely valuable to anyone who could get their hands on it. Instead, the Machines seemed to have abandoned it completely, leaving the wind and sand to the slow, steady task of stripping the paint from the silent structures.

[i]At least the sun is nice and bright overhead.[/i] she thought. [i]This place is already eerie enough as it is.[/i]

"We can only speculate on why this site is deserted, friend Ada," Sophia said. "But at the end of the day, their loss has become our gain. We should focus on what we have in front of us, rather than indulge in endless speculation to the point of paralysis."

"Don''t look a gift horse in the mouth, eh?" She gave a small shrug, even as a small gust deposited a fresh layer of sediment on the nearby dropship pad. "Well, you''re right in that there''s no use spending the day making unsupported guesses. Let''s get the nanolathe warmed up."

"Still nothing on those radar returns, Sophia?"

The AI gave Ada an old-fashioned look, and she blushed a little. "Sorry. I know you''d notify me immediately if you [i]did[/i] turn something up. It''s just... this waiting for the other shoe to drop is getting on my nerves. And knowing [i]someone[/i] is out there, but not knowing [i]who[/i], is not conducive to me being able to relax on this seemingly deserted planet."

Sophia nodded. "I understand. Perhaps we should set up an aircraft factory to better survey the surrounding region."

"Good idea. Alright, do it-"

The loud wail of the alarm jerked Ada half out of her seat, as the tactical plot automatically popped up in front of her. The sprinkling of red icons shown converging on the base was bad enough; the reality they represented was far worse.

"A surprise attack... with shieldbots," Sophia murmured dispassionately. "Quite a feat. Not that they''ll need much subtlety for this one, with those numbers they''re bringing to bear."

"Identification?" Ada snapped, even as she already knew the answer inside.

"...See for yourself." A communications screen appeared beside the map overview, and Ada felt her fists tighten as the distinctive avatar appeared. Only one group in the galaxy used those images of almost-but-not-quite human figures, with skins of polished chrome and steel in place of flesh.

"I am the Free Machine," he said in a voice of liquid nitrogen. "So, the little human has fallen into the spider''s web. Surrender and you will be permitted a dignified death."

Caedmon leaned forward, her face hard. "You''re badly mistaken if you think we''re just going to roll over in a fight, toaster. Why don''t you turn around and go home before somewhat gets hurt?"

The Machine snorted. "Your words are big, but they do not compare to our strength and will. Resist as you please; we shall savor your destruction all the more." And with that, he vanished.

Ada turned back to the plot, grimacing at the growing number of hostiles it displayed, and shot her companion a concerned glance. "Sophia," she tried to keep her voice even, "I know I talked tough back there, but any good ideas you could come up with now would be very much appreciated."
