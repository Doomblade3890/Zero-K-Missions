[i]"I am the Lord thy God. Thou shall have no other gods before me. Thou shall not use my name in vain. I am a jealous God, and my inquity shall be felt for..."[/i]

"Ada?"

"Mmh?" She looked up from the screen, blinking, then shook her head. "Sorry, Sophia. Just spaced out for a moment there."

The tan-faced avatar tilted her head. "If you find my analysis of the Grayson Schism to be excessively dull, friend Ada, perhaps I can find you something more to your interests."

"No, no, it''s not like that. I was just... thinking. About the whole... shroud of mysticism that''s surrounded humanity in these times."

"Indeed?" It didn''t sound like a question, but neither was it quite a statement. More of a subtle prod to continue, as a younger Sophia had done so many times to a much younger Ada Caedmon back in the early days.

"What I''m saying is," she tapped the holographic display with the back of her hand, "the Emperor was venerated even back then, sure, and the powers he wielded were essentially autocratic in fact if not in name... but he was still human, and treated as such. You could get away with criticizing him - some of the time, anyway - and you could actually [i]see[/i] his face. Now? Oppose him in any way and you get a literal crusade on your head, even though nobody ever sees him and for all they know he''s been dead for a thousand years."

With a sigh, she leaned back in the command seat. "I wonder... having left our gods behind on Old Earth, did we eventually have no choice but to turn to ourselves to fill the gap? A god from the man, as it were? Or perhaps, having matched and surpassed the powers of the ancient deities, we only saw fit to place ourselves among their ranks, to lord it over our creations as they had once been seen to rule us?"

She stared at the ceiling. "And now the last god is seemingly asleep, unheard from, yet still commanding an army of followers. A parable about hubris, blind faith and history repeating itself, all in one convenient package."

"We''ll resolve this when we get to Throne," Sophia said. "One way or another."

"I hope so," Ada sighed again. "I sure hope so."

The wormhole transit, like all others, was an imperceptible thing to the human senses. One moment the [i]Shadow of Eden[/i] was orbiting a nameless white dwarf near the inner boundary of the Trajan Sector; the next, it was bathed in the K1 light of the Sirocco System, over two hundred light-years away in the heart of the Khusrau Sector. The display of the results from the pre-battle checks on the new Sunburst Cannon that Sophia had recently installed on her command unit didn''t even flicker.

"Sensor effectiveness at thirty-seven percent of nominal," Sophia announced. "Unidentified vessels detected in orbit around Barchan."

The plot of the space around the system''s second planet came up, surrounded by the blinking icons of what the ship''s passives were slowly resolving as dropships. Ada narrowed her eyes as the FTL transponders pinged the [i]Eden[/i], naming each ship in turn... and felt her fingers close into a fist as one of them identified herself as the [i]Cornelia[/i].

"Well, well," she said after a while. "Looks like our good friend Astra is right here, hosting a barbarian convention... and we weren''t invited."

"So it would seem." Sophia looked at her human companion. "That is quite a formidable force, Ada. Do you wish to wait for them to disperse?"

"No, that just means more work hunting them down later." A quick glance over at a new console, reviewing her notes. "You told me earlier that they''re as likely to fight each other as the Imperials or us, right?"

"Indeed. You are saying, then, that they present the same opportunity for defeat in detail as they would if they were actually physically dispersed?"

"Exactly." Her open palm snapped into a solid fist. "We pry them one by one out of that little melee they have going on down there, crush them into dust, bend their tribes to our will, and sweep up the Imperial forces here like a stormwind." She paused for a moment, then smiled sheepishly. "That''s the general idea, anyway. I''ll work out the details as we go."

"They may unite against the common threat we present to them," Sophia pointed out.

Ada shook her head. "If they were going to do that, they''d have done it against the Imperials. No, this is our best chance at this. Can you take those dropships, Sophia?"

"I can''t kill them, no. Dropships aren''t built for ship-to-ship combat. But by the same token," Sophia smiled thinly, "the only way they can take the [i]Eden[/i] down is by ramming. Needless to say... they won''t pull that off."

"Well, then," the feral grin was back, "I think it''s time we crashed this party."
