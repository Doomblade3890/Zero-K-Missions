  "econTutorial_objTitle_tut": "Complete Economy Tutorial",
  "econTutorial_persistent_areaCommands": "Reclaim and repair can be given as \\255\\255\\255\\0\\area commands\\008. Press \\255\\0\\255\\0\\R\\008 and \\255\\0\\255\\0\\click and drag\\008 a circle on the ground to issue an area repair command. Reclaim is the same, except the hotkey is \\255\\0\\255\\0\\E\\008.\n\nTry it now. Repair the solar collectors and reclaim the wreckages to continue.",
  "econTutorial_persistent_assistFac": "You can give construction units a \\255\\255\\255\\0\\Guard\\008 order on a factory to \\255\\255\\255\\0\\assist\\008 it and help it build faster. Select your commander and \\255\\0\\255\\0\\right click\\008 on the factory.\n\nBuild five more Glaives. Same deal as before; your commander needs to be assisting the factory for it to work.",
  "econTutorial_persistent_buildUnits": "Let's make some units with our factory. Build three \\255\\0\\255\\255\\Glaive\\008 bots.\n\n+ Select your new factory\n+ Left click the \\255\\255\\255\\0\\Units\\008 tab\n+ Left click Glaive three times",
  "econTutorial_persistent_destroyEnemyBase": "Well done.\n\nThere's one last thing left to do. Somewhere in the lowlands is an \\255\\255\\255\\0\\enemy factory\\008. Use your newly built units and destroy it.",
  "econTutorial_persistent_energy": "Now that we have our stuff up and running, let's take a look at something else.\n\n\\255\\255\\255\\0\\Energy\\008 is the other basic resource. You need an equal amount of metal and energy to build things, and energy is also used to repair units and operate certain abilities like cloaking.\n\nYou can see your current metal and energy finances in the \\255\\255\\255\\0\\resource panel\\008 (circled). It shows how much you're earning, how much you have stored and how much you're spending.\n\nClick Next to continue.",

Now that we have metal and energy, it's time to spend it with a \\255\\255\\255\\0\\factory\\008.\n\nBuild a  \\255\\0\\255\\255\\Cloaky Bot Factory\\008.\n+ Select your commander\n+ Left click the Factory tab in the menu (highlighted)\n+ Left click the Cloaky Bot Factory button\n+ Left click on the ground where you want to place the building\n\nThe factory icon over your commanders' head means you have a free factory ready to deploy (a \"\\255\\255\\255\\0\\facplop\\008\").",

  "econTutorial_persistent_mex": "Good work. Now let's make a \\255\\0\\255\\255\\Metal Extractor\\008 (\"mex\" for short) as well.\n\nMetal extractors can only be built on \\255\\255\\255\\0\\metal spots\\008. You can make them in the same way as the Solar Collector, but there are also easier options: select your comm, press \\255\\0\\255\\0\\W\\008 and drag a circle on the ground to give an \\255\\255\\255\\0\\area mex\\008 command.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding metal spots, press \\255\\0\\255\\0\\F4\\008 for the economy view.",
  "econTutorial_persistent_reclaim": "Metal can also be obtained by \\255\\255\\255\\0\\reclaiming\\008 the \\255\\255\\255\\0\\wreckages\\008 that dead units leave on the battlefield.

  "econTutorial_persistent_repeat": "That was easy. But having to give your factory fresh build orders each time can be troublesome.

  "econTutorial_persistent_solar": "Several buildings produce energy, but the \\255\\0\\255\\255\\Solar Collector\\008 is the most basic. Let's build one.\n+ Select your commander\n+ Left click the \\255\\255\\255\\0\\Econ\\008 tab in the menu (highlighted)\n+ Left click the Solar Collector button\n+ Left click on the ground where you want to place the building\n\nTIP: Hold down \\255\\0\\255\\0\\Shift\\008 to click and drag a line of buildings.",
