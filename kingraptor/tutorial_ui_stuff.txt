	- Press A and click on the target, or right click on the target

	- Destroy the target vehicle to the east to continue
	
5) Fight move
	- We've ordered your commander to _Fire at Will_ again
	- A Fight order will make your unit stop to engage enemies (in contrast to a move order which makes them focus on getting to their destination)
	- Constructors with a Fight order will randomly find something appropriate to do (repair, reclaim wreckages, etc.) as they move
	- Demo
		- The unit on the left is on a Move order
		- The unit on the right is on a Fight order
		- Which is better? It depends on what you need to do
